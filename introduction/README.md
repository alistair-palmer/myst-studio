Myst is the most advanced and intuitive DevOps solution for Oracle Middleware. It enables users to quickly establish a standardized, repeatable and automated process across their organization for provisioning and managing their Oracle Middleware platform as well as automating the build and deployment of Oracle Middleware applications. All with Zero Scripting.

This allows users to transform what is typically a resource intensive and highly error prone process into one that is automated, predictable and low risk.

In this guide we will learn about using Myst to deliver Automation, Auditability and Governance of [Platform Change](/introduction/platform-provisioning/README.md) and [Application Release](/introduction/application-release-automation/README.md) for Oracle Middleware.

When following the User Guide you will need to have access to Myst Studio. For details on installing Myst please visit the [Myst Studio Installation Guide](/installation/myst-studio/README.md).
